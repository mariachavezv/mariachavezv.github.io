2. My GitHub account was created for school purposes for the first time.
3. The repository I created has my name for the title and will be used for adding files in it for future assignments.
4. To clone my repository I clicked the plus sign in GitHub Desktop and chose the option for cloning a repository. I then chose the repository I previously created.
